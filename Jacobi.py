"""
Performs Jacobi iterations to solve the line system of equations, Ax=b, 
starting from an initial guess, ``x0``.

Terminates when the change in x is less than ``tol``, or
if ``N`` [default=200] iterations have been exceeded.

Receives 5 parameters:
    1.  a, the NxN matrix that method is being performed on.
    2.  b, vector of solution. 
    3.  X0,  the desired initial guess.
        if x is None, the initial guess will bw determined as a vector of 0's.
    4.  TOL, tolerance- the desired limitation of tolerance of solution's anomaly.
        if tolerance is None, the default value will set as 1e-16.
    5.  N, the maxim number of possible iterations to receive the most exact solution.
        if N is None, the default value will set as 200.

Returns variables:
    1.  x, the estimated solution
