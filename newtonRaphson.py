"""
Input function f, initial guess x0, tolerance TOL, maximum iterations N

For n from 1 to N:
    Calculate the derivative of the function at x0:
        df = derivative of f at x0

    If df â‰ˆ 0:
        Print "Derivative is approximately zero. Algorithm failed."
        Exit

    Calculate the change in x using Newton-Raphson method:
        d = f(x0) / df

    If the absolute value of d is less than TOL:
        Return x0 as the approximate root

    Update x0 for the next iteration:
        x0 = x0 - d

Return x0 as the current approximation if the maximum iterations are reached
